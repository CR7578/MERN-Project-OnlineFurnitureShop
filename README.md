# Online Furniture Shop üõãÔ∏èüõçÔ∏è

## Project Overview

The **Online Furniture Shop** is a comprehensive web application designed to offer customers a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience. With a fully responsive design, this application ensures users can browse and shop for furniture items effortlessly across both desktop and mobile devices. The platform enables customers to explore, select, and purchase a wide range of furniture, all from the comfort of their homes.

The **Online Furniture Shop** is aimed at both residential and commercial customers, offering a diverse selection of furniture to match various styles and preferences. üè°üè¢

## Project Description üíª

Our **Online Furniture Shop** is a user-friendly full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) project that provides customers with a hassle-free browsing experience, without the need for prior registration. Users can explore a variety of furniture categories, add items to their cart, and create personalized shopping lists. 

Registration is required only during checkout to ensure secure payment processing. Registered users enjoy additional features such as:

- **Order Tracking:** Monitor order status and delivery progress.
- **Order History:** View past orders and make quick re-purchases.
- **Profile Management:** Easily update personal information such as name, address, contact number, and email.

For administrators, the system offers comprehensive capabilities to manage:

- **Furniture Categories:** Add, modify, or delete categories.
- **Product Management:** Add, update, or remove furniture products.
- **Order Processing:** Efficiently manage customer orders and update inventory.

The system guarantees an up-to-date catalog, a responsive user interface, secure payment processing, and effective inventory and order management. üîÑüõ†Ô∏è

## Problem Statement ‚ö†Ô∏è

Many existing furniture shopping platforms require users to create an account before browsing products, which may discourage potential customers. Additionally, current systems often lack sufficient user profile management, order tracking, and efficient administrative functionalities, leading to poor user engagement and administrative challenges. 

There is a clear need for an online furniture shop that:

- **Improves the browsing experience** without forcing users to register.
- **Enhances user profile management** and order tracking.
- **Streamlines administrative functions** for easier management of products and orders.

## Existing System üèöÔ∏è

Most current online furniture shops impose mandatory registration for users to access product listings. This leads to a higher bounce rate, as many users prefer to explore products before committing to account creation. Moreover, existing systems may lack comprehensive features for user profile management, order tracking, and efficient administrative controls, which can result in a subpar shopping experience.

## Limitations of Existing Systems üö´

The key limitations of existing furniture shopping systems are:

- **Mandatory Registration:** Users are forced to sign up before browsing, which creates a barrier for exploration.
- **Limited Profile Management:** Users have limited control over their personal data and preferences.
- **No Order Tracking:** Customers cannot easily track their orders after purchase.
- **Inefficient Administration:** Admin users face difficulties managing categories, products, and orders efficiently.

These limitations can decrease user satisfaction, reduce engagement, and increase the complexity of administrative tasks. üòû

## Proposed System üí°

The proposed **Online Furniture Shop** offers a significant upgrade over existing systems by allowing users to browse products without the need for registration. This feature greatly enhances the user experience, especially for new customers who want to explore products before committing to an account.

Key features include:

- **Comprehensive User Profile Management:** Users can easily update their name, address, contact number, and email.
- **Order Tracking:** Customers can track their orders in real-time.
- **Admin Controls:** Admins can manage categories, products, and orders with greater efficiency.

By eliminating unnecessary steps, the proposed system makes online furniture shopping more convenient for customers while also providing powerful tools for administrators. ‚ú®

**2. Clone the repository**
- Clone Github repo project source code 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CR7578/MERN-Project-OnlineFurnitureShop.git
```
- Change the directory into cloned project
```bash
cd MERN-Project-OnlineFurnitureShop
```

**Install the necessary npm packages** for the server-side by running:

```

**Client-side (Frontend)**
- After installing the server-side dependencies, navigate to the client directory by running:
```bash
cd client
```

- Install the required npm packages in client folder for React by running:
```bash
npm i
```
This will install the necessary packages for the frontend.

After the installation is complete, go back to the main folder by running:
```bash
cd ..
```

**3. Setup Environment Variables**
- Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following variables:

Edit this .env values
```text
PORT=8080
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/<DATABASE NAME >
